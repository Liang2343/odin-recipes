    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      A salted cod salad is a dish that features salted codfish as the star
      ingredient, combined with various vegetables, herbs, and seasonings.
      Salted cod (also called bacalhau in Portuguese, baccal√† in Italian, or
      bacalao in Spanish) is codfish that has been preserved through salting and
      drying. This process intensifies its flavor and requires soaking in water
      to rehydrate and remove excess salt before cooking.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb of salted cod</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 large tomato, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 large avocado or a whole small avocado, diced</li>
      <li>3 hard-boiled eggs, quartered</li>
      <li>12 green olives (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak salted cod in cool water for 15 - 30 minutes. Drain and transfer
        cod to a pot. Cover with water and bring to a simmer on the stovetop.
        Change the water and bring it to a simmer 3 - 4 more times or until cod
        reaches desired saltiness. Drain, using a fork break up the cod and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute onion in a skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil until soft and
        translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl combine cod with onions and remaining ingredients. Toss
        until well combined. If the salad is too dry to your liking add more
        olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with rice or boiled yucca root drizzled with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
